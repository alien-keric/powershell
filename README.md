# powershell
- simple modified powershell can be used to gain access from one user to another using but it needs what is know as password

assume we have managed to get a shell and we have meet something like this maybe 
```
public final class Playercounter extends JavaPlugin {  
  public void onEnable() {  
    Rcon rcon = null;  
    try {  
      rcon = new Rcon("127.0.0.1", 27015, "s67u84zKq8IXw".getBytes());  
    } catch (IOException e) {  
      throw new RuntimeException(e);  
    } catch (AuthenticationException e2) {  
      throw new RuntimeException(e2);


This issue can be referenced from a craft machine from hack the box
```

- If we try to discete the code we can see that this code here tried to make a connection to the port 27015 from localhosts while using password as "s67u84zKq8IXw"
